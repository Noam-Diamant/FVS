# The sokoban solver
In this project we present a code designed to solve boards of the Sokoban game.
The code will be run according to one of the options that will be presented, and according to the instructions that will be presented below.

For the code you wrote there are 3 execution options:

Option 2 - running the code, receiving an answer as to whether the board is solvable, and if so, in what way.

Option 3 - Comparison of runtime between BDD and SAT engines in a given board solution.

Option 4 - comparison of running time between a normal solution and an iterative solution of a given board.

## option 2
